Prescriptris

Prescriptris is a tongue-in-cheek, retro-inspired puzzle game that mashes up the classic block-stacking fun of Tetris with the quirky world of pharmacy. Instead of plain old squares, you’ll be fitting pill-shaped blocks into perfect prescription bottles, building 2×2 (and larger) "bottles" for bonus points.


🌟 Game Theme & Purpose

Imagine yourself as a pixelated pharmacist on a mission to fill endless prescriptions. Pills (blocks) fall from the sky, and it’s your job to:

Arrange them into neat 2×2 squares (and bigger) to bottle them out of the grid.

Clear lines Tetris-style for a steady 10 pts per line.

Rack up bonuses: 2×2 → 20 pts, 3×3 → 45 pts, 4×4 → 80 pts!

Survive as the pace speeds up every 5 seconds—no time for a coffee break!

Between frantic bottle-stacking and frantic game-over screens, Prescriptris is all about that perfect Rx flow and high-score glory.


🎮 How to Play

Move the falling pill blocks left/right with ← and →.

Rotate them with ↑ to fit your prescription bottles.

Soft drop with ↓ to speed things up.

Hold one piece (press C) to swap for later—your secret pharmacy stash.

Form squares of pills (2×2 or larger) to bottle them. Bonus points rain down!

Clear full lines for steady refill points (10 pts/line).

Keep going—the medicine doesn’t stop, and neither do your pills.

Any key after Game Over restarts with your high score preserved.
